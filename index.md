title: Bueler's Math F617 in Spring 2024 at UAF
---

Welcome to the public homepage of **Math F617 Functional Analysis**, Spring 2024, in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).

If you plan to be present on campus in Fairbanks during the semester, please sign up for the in-person "901" section (crn 35367), and plan to attend lecture in Chapman 107.  If you are remote, signing up for the web-based "701" section (crn 35378) is just fine!

#### Instructor:  [Ed Bueler](http://bueler.github.io/)

Email me at [elbueler@alaska.edu](mailto:elbueler@alaska.edu).  I hold [office hours](http://bueler.github.io/OffHrs.htm) in Chapman 306C.

### Canvas course page

Log in to [canvas.alaska.edu/courses/18441](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/18441) for the lecture Zoom link, Homework and Exam solutions, and to see your grades.

### Getting Started

* Attend lectures: MWF 2:15-3:15pm in Chapman 107, or online.

* Read the [Syllabus (PDF)](assets/general/S24/syllabus.pdf).

* The [Schedule (PDF)](assets/general/S24/schedule.pdf) is my longer-term plan.  Check it for exam dates and due dates, and for which topics come next!

* The [daily log](daily) has the recent happenings, including handouts and worksheets as PDFs.

* Check out the nearly-weekly [homework Assignments](homework).

* There are three Exams, two Midterm Quizzes and a Final.  All are in class, and the Final will happen at the scheduled time.  See the [Exams](exams) tab for review guides.
